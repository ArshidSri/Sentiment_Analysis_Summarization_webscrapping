    "### Inspiration for the project:\n",
    "Stock Market is a huge gamble for some because they are not informed with proper data to make the right decisions. People take a lot of time in deciding which Cafe they would walk into but not spend enough time on the stock they invest. It is because people have less time but this is when AI comes to the rescue. Abstractive summarization and webscrapping seems to aid us more to gather the required information to make the right decisions.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Big thumbs up to <a href=\"https://www.jovian.ai\">Jovian</a> team for introducing the concept of sentiment analysis in their free course assignments which paved the way for the current pipelines of the project. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/nicholasrenotte\">Nicholas Reonette</a> for his work on NLP code which is highly customizable for any NLP project which is the base for the pipeline 2 of my project."

NCB will offer 0.739 new shares for each Samba share, at the lower end of the 0.736-0.787 ratio the banks set when they signed an initial framework agreement in June.The offer is a 3.5 percentage premium to Samba’s Oct. 8 closing price of 27.50 riyals and about 24 percentage higher than the level the shares traded at before the talks were made public. Bloomberg News first reported the merger discussions.The new bank will have total assets of more than 220 billion, creating the Gulf region third-largest lender. The entity’s 46 billion market capitalization nearly matches that of Qatar National Bank QPSC, which is still the Middle East’s biggest lender with about 268 billion of assets. </br>\n",

       "  \" Passwords are probably the worst part about connecting to the web. At Yahoo Finance, we’re asked to change our passwords several times a year, and they need to be incredibly long. Oh, and you can’t use the same phrase more than once. And while those are the best ways to stay safe online, they’re still a hassle. To that end, Microsoft (MSFT) is releasing its passwordless login technology for all consumers. Rather than logging in with a password, the company will now let you type in your username, then use either the Microsoft Authenticator app, Windows Hello, a physical security key, or a phone or email verification to access your Outlook, OneDrive, Microsoft Family Safety, and other apps. The company is also working on expanding this to additional services including Xbox accounts in the future. You’ll need to set up the feature before you can start using it, though, which means you’ll have to set up the passwordless option yourself. To do so, you’ll have to download the Microsoft Authenticator app — it’s available for iOS and Android — and link it to your account. Then you’ll need to sign in to your Microsoft account via a browser, and go to the Advanced Security Options page and turn on Passwordless Account. From there you can follow the on-screen instructions to determine how to use the feature. I’ve been using passwordless sign in on my Microsoft account for a while now using the Authenticator app, and it’s proven far easier than forgetting my password and having to reset it every month. I type in my email, click log-in and get a prompt from the Authenticator app asking if I'm trying to sign in. Then I just follow the on-screen directions, and I'm in.\\xa0 You can also choose to go back to using passwords at any time if you’d like. But that would be crazy. Of course, there are other means of keeping yourself safe online too. LastPass is a service that acts as a master password for all of the sites that you log in to, eliminating the need to\",\n",
       "  \" This article was originally published on Simply Wall St News What trends should we look for if we want to identify stocks that create value over the long term? We'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE), an ever-increasing base of capital employed, and finally a cost of capital lower than the return. This shows us that the company is continually reinvesting its earnings back into the business and generates higher returns. So, here is what we found when we looked at the ROCE trend of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Microsoft: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.29 = US$70b ÷ (US$334b - US$89b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2021). So, Microsoft has an ROCE of 29%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Software industry average of 10.0%.  Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft  In the above chart we have measured Microsoft's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Microsoft. In the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown from 17%, considerably to 29%. This implies that management is investing in some better projects and acquisitions. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used than it did three years ago, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 82%. When looking at the returns on capital employed, we get a better sense of the quality of the metric by comparing it to the cost of capital. If the return is greater than the cost, then we can argue that the company is creating value by making smart moves. The cost of capital\",\n",
       "  ' (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp., the world’s largest software maker, announced its largest ever stock-repurchase program of as much as $60 billion, at a time when U.S. lawmakers are considering a tax on buybacks. The company’s recent resurgence has given it a market value north of $2.2 trillion, making it the second-most valuable publicly traded company after a 35% rise in its shares over 2021. Its previous buyback plan, unveiled in September 2019, was for $40 billion. Microsoft’s latest purchase scheme comes after two senior Democratic senators proposed a 2% tax on corporate stock buybacks as part of a bid to help fund a $3.5 trillion U.S. budget bill. The potential tax, announced on Friday, was released by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden of Oregon and Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown of Ohio, in a bid to boost company investment and reduce tax avoidance. Although Microsoft did not say in its statement Tuesday how it would fund its buyback, it’s currently sitting on a cash pile of more than $130 billion that it has used to fund acquisitions and to boost dividends and buybacks. The current buyback has no expiration date, and may be terminated at any time. Microsoft also increased its quarterly dividend by 6 cents to 62 cents a share. Its shares were up 1% as the market opened in New York on Wednesday. Microsoft also appointed President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith as vice chair. Smith, who joined Microsoft in 1993 and became general counsel in 2002, will continue to report to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, the Redmond, Washington-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Smith’s new role makes him vice chair of the company, not the board, and he won’t become a director, Microsoft said. In recent years, Smith has taken on oversight of an expanding list of policy, government and legal issues at Microsoft, including relations with foreign governments like China, political giving, and programs to expand rural broadband service and access to job skills.

Here is what the fund said: \"Shares of Microsoft Corporation, a cloud-software leader and provider of software productivity tools and infrastructure, rose during the quarter following a strong earnings report highlighting solid demand for its broad product stack and continued momentum migrating its business to the cloud. Microsoft was a top contributor in the period because it trades at reasonable free cash flow and earnings valuations, has cloud and digital transformation tailwinds at its back, reported a solid March quarter, and beat Street expectations by a wide margin. Microsoft’s results continued to be strong across the board, with Azure cloud computing revenues up 46% in constantcurrency (“cc”) terms and commercial cloud bookings growth of 38% cc, the best in years. Microsoft also reported robust profitability growth, with operating income expanding 31% and GAAP earnings up 45%.

       "  ' Coming back from the Labor Day weekend, Tesla (TSLA) shares marked a 2.64% gain on Tuesday, trading at just over $750 by market close. And while some experts are targeting $3,000 per share, TD Ameritrade Chief Market Strategist JJ Kinahan explains why TD’s clients are selling Tesla in the near term. “[TD Ameritrade’s clients] sold [Tesla shares] in July and August, which I think is very interesting overall,” Kinahan told Yahoo Finance Live. “[They sold for] a couple of reasons. Number one, because when Tesla gets back above $700, it seems to bring people out as sellers a little bit more.” Indeed, the $700 mark has demonstrated itself to be a key support for the EV manufacturer’s shares, with Tesla last dipping below $700 in mid-August. Kinahan described the $700 level as being a “magnet on the stock.” The second reason, Kinahan believes, has more to do with the growing competition Tesla is facing in the EV space. Though it has not all been smooth sailing for emerging players such as GM (GM), with its recent recall expansion to cover all Chevy Bolt model years over a battery fire risk, the prospect of EV rivals getting hot on the heels of Tesla may be spurring TD Ameritrade’s clients toward buying into the competition. “The competition has heated up so significantly over the last year,” Kinahan added. “You see Ford (F) and GM as two stocks that our clients were actually buying as they sell Tesla.” Ford and GM shares are up this year approximately 48% and 18%, respectively, while Tesla lags behind at around 7%. While Ford and GM have demonstrated their ability to move units, Kinahan said, the OEMs have yet to prove their worth in the EV space compared to Tesla. For now, he cited Tesla’s superior battery technology and manufacturing capabilities as giving the company a leg up. “Tesla, obviously, has better battery technology that gives them an advantage over others,” Kinahan said. “But I think what our clients are really looking for is Ford and GM to continue to pick up their game and this',\n",

There is little doubt that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), the electric vehicle (EV) maker headquartered in California, has made giant strides in establishing itself as the biggest name in not only the EV space but also the automotive industry as a whole over the last decade. The company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has a market capitalization of $720 billion. Since the IPO in 2010, the stock has surged more than 20,000%. However, it is also one of the most high volume names on the market, a stock characteristic that often leads to price volatility.  After registering a record rally that lasted through most of last year - Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock price jumped more than 700% between February 2020 and February 2021 - the stock has been taking a breather since April on the back of concerns around slowing EV demand, a global chip shortage that has affected EV production, and a dramatic fall in the price of cryptocurrencies. The company is heavily invested in the new technology and reportedly bought more than $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin earlier this year.  Despite these concerns, some of which have been around for years, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has continued to consistently beat the market on growth, smash earnings expectations on Wall Street, and provide investors with record returns. For example, in earnings results for the second quarter, posted on July 26, the company reported earnings per share of $1.45, beating market predictions by $0.47. The revenue over the period was close to $12 billion, up 98% year-on-year and beating analyst estimates by $560 million.  The delivery numbers of Tesla, Inc.

That\\'s about 100 miles more than Tesla\\'s model S Long Range.\\xa0 The EV maker\\'s CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson has said in previous interviews that Lucid\\'s car could go farther on one full battery charge than Tesla\\'s vehicle.

And then a focus on the powertrain tech as well as the luxury market,\" said Murphy.\\xa0 The analyst points to Lucid\\'s plan to roll out its high-end vehicles with luxury price tags first. Releasing the priciest models first is similar to Tesla\\'s early strategy.\\xa0 The upgrade is a stark contrast to Morgan Stanley’s recent initiation of the stock. Earlier this week, analyst Adam Jonas recommended an Underweight rating and price target of $12 per share. Lucid went public on July 26 via a SPAC merger with Churchill Capital IV. That day LCID closed at $26.83. The EV maker placed its first US production factory in Casa Grande, Arizona.

       " 'BTC': [' Cryptocurrency bulls are lauding the decision by El Salvador to become the first country to accept bitcoin as legal tender. And one bitcoin fund manager believes other countries in emerging markets around the world could possibly follow suit. Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale Investments, the world\\'s largest cryptocurrency fund manager by assets ($32 billion as of Sept. 3), spoke with Yahoo Finance Live and speculated where such countries could be located. \"When we think about where [increasing] adoption rates are taking place, they\\'re the highest in the emerging markets — in places like Africa, Southeast Asia, [and] parts of South America. So it would be tough to think about which other countries [besides El Salvador] where bitcoin could serve as legal tender,\" he said. El Salvador made the U.S. dollar its official currency in 2001, joining the ranks of seven similarly-situated countries — including Ecuador, Panama and the Republic of Zimbabwe. They don\\'t control their own monetary policy due to their dollar adoption. However, they are only exposed to inflation as it pertains to the U.S. dollar, which has avoided double-digit inflation since the 1970s. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele promoted the drive toward a dual fiat-crypto national currency as a way to avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in fees incurred as the country\\'s expats remit payments to relatives and friends domestically.\\xa0 Such remittances reached a record $5.92 billion in 2020, or nearly one-quarter of the country\\'s gross domestic product. According to World Bank data, the average remittance fee from the U.S. to El Salvador was 2.91% in the fist quarter, which yields a conservative estimate of $172 million annually in fees. Bukele claims the savings will be higher, at $400 million annually.\\xa0 Comparing these fees to bitcoin transaction fees is tricky, as they are dependent on many variables, especially the traffic on the network. But this also means senders can simply wait out the high traffic periods and send later when fees are lower. None of this addresses the program\\'s biggest concern — the now-infamous volatility of bitcoin, which regularly endures corrections of more than 30%, often',\n",
       "  ' This week\\'s \"flash crash\" that dragged bitcoin (BTC-USD) back below $50,000 — and sent other digital coins reeling in its wake — marred what should have been the momentous occasion of the first sovereign country on earth adopting a cryptocurrency as legal tender.\\xa0 Despite the ugly price action, most of crypto\\'s true believers are still just that — even as some observers question bitcoin\\'s head-spinning volatility, and El Salvador\\'s decision to throw its weight behind it.\\xa0 Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale Investments, the world\\'s largest cryptocurrency fund manager by assets, who told Yahoo Finance Live this week that other countries are likely to join El Salvador in the race to make crypto legal tender. And Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise, also told Yahoo Finance Live that “it’s the greatest time, I think, to enter the crypto market. A lot of the first decade of crypto was about zero to one. … Now the question is how fast we scale from one to 100. A lot of that is built on what regulatory clarity we get.” To be sure, it\\'s been a rocky week for digital currencies like bitcoin — which traded above $52,000 on Monday but hovered near $45,000 on Friday — as well as ethereum (ETH-USD) and Cardano (ADA-USD). However, from peak to trough, the latter two didn\\'t lose nearly as much as bitcoin, which suffered offshore outflows upwards of $3 billion during Tuesday\\'s selloff, according to one investor. On the other hand, the price of cryptocurrency (SOL1-USD), which power the Solana blockchain, is already above its pre-flash crash highs, trading above $175 on Friday.\\xa0 In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Jeff Sekinger, a financial guru, founder of the Miami-based crypto hedge fund Orca Capital, said he believes overall crypto market will likely see a lot of growth through the end of this year, despite this week\\'s rout. Like the week of Coinbase’s initial public offering, this week began with another major market event — El Salvador’s new Bitcoin Law, which was expected to be a boon to the industry. Sekinger has witnessed his share of crypto market',\n",
       "  ' Major cryptocurrencies were down on Friday morning after a volatile week amid rising concerns over bitcoin\\'s environmental impact. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down 0.4%, still struggling to cross the $50,000 (£36,237) mark. It was trading at $47,900 at the time of writing. Many supporters on Twitter are hopeful it will hit $100,000 by the end of the year. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the second biggest crypto by market cap, was down 2.6% to trade at $3,524. Over the past month bitcoin had made a brief foray over $50,000 but this proved short-lived, with the crypto not quite getting the boost some may have expected after El Salvador officially started accepting it as legal tender last week. The rollout was rocky, marred by tech difficulties and protests from concerned citizens. However, since then, the situation has steadied. Reports suggest issues with the government’s Chivo digital wallet, necessary for transactions, are being resolved and more than half a million people are using the wallet. But bitcoin is still not being able to gain momentum. The amount of bitcoin held on exchanges like Coinbase (COIN) and Binance, have dropped to lower than they were in November last year and bitcoin exchange reserves reportedly hit new multi-year lows this week. This comes as analysis by economists from the Dutch central bank and MIT shows that a single bitcoin transaction generates the same amount of electronic waste as throwing away two iPhones. “We estimate that the whole bitcoin network currently cycles through 30.7 metric kilotons of equipment per year. This number is comparable to the amount of small IT and telecommunication equipment waste produced by a country like the Netherlands,\" according to the paper, published in the journal Resources, Conservation and Recycling.

Pipes maintained Riot Blockchain with a Buy rating and raised the price target from $51 to $82. The analyst\\'s model now assumes a $45,000 Bitcoin price versus the prior assumption of a $35,000 Bitcoin price. The model was also adjusted to reflect higher miner costs. Despite higher costs, unit economics for digital mining remains \"highly attractive,\" according to the analyst. “While these adjustments represent a large increase from our prior estimates, we believe our model is still conservative,\" Pipes said. Marathon Digital is focused on mining digital assets. It owns crypto-currency mining machines and a data center to mine the digital assets.

What Happened: Aron announced this week that AMC Entertainment Holdings will accept Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Litecoin (CRYPTO: LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (CRYPTO: BTC) transactions as payment. The announcement came after Aron said on the second quarter earnings call that the movie theater company would accept Bitcoin payments by the end of the year.

Aron told CNBC in early September that the company was exploring NFTs as a way to grow the business. “There are some ideas that have surfaced,” Aron said. The CEO indicated that adding NFTs to the business model could create “real value” for AMC investors and the company. “One of the ones I particularly love is to make commemorative movie tickets as an NFT.” Aron told CNBC that it could be a “really smart idea” to launch movie ticket NFTs as the movie chain has 50 to 100 big releases in theaters a year. The move could make NFTs “mean something for us and customers,” Aron added. The launch of NFTs could drive the business going forward. CNBC Fast Money member']}"

That\\'s about 100 miles more than Tesla\\'s model S Long Range.\\xa0 The EV maker\\'s CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson has said in previous interviews that Lucid\\'s car could go farther on one full battery charge than Tesla\\'s vehicle. Now it has the EPA\\'s official rating to prove it.\\xa0 Also on Thursday the stock received a bullish outlook from Bank of America analyst John Murphy, who set a $30 price target on the stock.\\xa0 \"I think it\\'s somewhat somewhere between a combination of Tesla and Ferrari,\" Murphy told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday.\\xa0 Murphy points to Rawlinson, who was chief engineer at Tesla for the model S prior to joining Lucid in 2013. \"They\\'ve got the combination of some real good know-how from the chief engineer of the model S at Tesla — great technology. And then a focus on the powertrain tech as well as the luxury market,\" said Murphy.\\xa0 The analyst points to Lucid\\'s plan to roll out its high-end vehicles with luxury price tags first. Releasing the priciest models first is similar to Tesla\\'s early strategy.\\xa0 The upgrade is a stark contrast to Morgan Stanley’s recent initiation of the stock. Earlier this week, analyst Adam Jonas recommended an Underweight rating and price target of $12 per share. Lucid went public on July 26 via a SPAC merger with Churchill Capital IV. That day LCID closed at $26.83. The EV maker placed its first US production factory in Casa Grande, Arizona. The company aims to meet its goals this year for two versions of its most expensive vehicle, the Air Dream Edition. On June 26, Lucid opened a showroom in New York City\\'s trendy meat packing district, just blocks away from Tesla\\'s showroom.
